# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter holds a blank spot without a value in your function and an argument is the value that takes that spot when you call a function.

Researched answer: Arguments are passed into the scope of a function through the placeholders that are parameters. The parameters are used to specify the expected input values for the function. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map takes in current value, current index and array of an higher order function. The value is the only required parameter it needs. 

Researched answer: Current value which represents the current element that .map is iterating over is the only required parameter .map needs to be used as a higher order function. Index of the current element and the original array are not needed if not used in a callback function.

3. What is the difference between map and filter? 

Your answer: Map or .map returns an array of the same length and filter or .filter returns a subset of an array. 

Researched answer: Map and filter both work on arrays. Both iterate over an array but they return different results. Map (.map) applies a callback function to the elements and returns a new array, same length as original, but with the results based on the callback function. Filter (.filter) returns a subset of the original array as a new array based on the passed conditions of a callback function.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: Actions that are repeated over and over until a condition is met.

Researched answer: Is the process of a block of code being executed continuously until a condition is met. A common form is called a for loop which defines an increment or decrement value for a variable on each iteration.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function is a recipe that performs a specific task. A method is a function that works with specific data types.

Researched answer: Functions are recyclable pieces of code that are invoked only when executed. Methods are associated with specific data types and work like a special function to manipulate that data type. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Lifting up a value in Javascript.

Researched answer: Hoisting is mechanism where before any code is executed a variable or function is moved to the top of the scope. A declaration (whether it is a function or variable) is hoisted not the initialization.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: In React, components can be broken into two categories: components that hold a state and components that do no hold a state.

2. Spread operator: allows you to take elements from one array and put them in another array.

3. React state: A special variable that stores data that the component uses to render itself or  tells it how to behave.

4. React props: React props are used to communicate data and behavior from parent component through component invocation down to a nest component and are unidirectional in the flow of information.

5. DOM events: allows for Javascript to be executed when an event occurs in an HTML element like a user click.
